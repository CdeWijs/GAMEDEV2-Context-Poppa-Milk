Hi everybody! I'm Poppa Milk!
Well I'm Circular dear boy! That means that during my production, my creators thought of what will become of me should i ever need to be destroyed.
This is also the reason why i'm this old and will never lose my value!
My game!
See, Steven created me, but without me the concept would fail
During the gameplay my creators decided to give me characteristics, showing the value of a product not in its quantity but in its goal
Yes yes, from best to worst: Rethink, Reduce, Re-use, Repair, Refurbish, Remanufacture, Repurpose, Recycle and Recover
I'm very excited for the future! I will also be there, as a glass bottle of milk i will never lose my value.
Hey Sten
Where did the man go when he lost his hand?
The second hand store! It's always better to re-use then to throw away and buy something new hehe!
Bye everybody!
Bye everybody!
