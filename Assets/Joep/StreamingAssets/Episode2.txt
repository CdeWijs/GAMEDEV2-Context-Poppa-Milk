This is remanufacturing. Here only part of the product is reused, the rest is left behind. This consumes less energy because the product does not have to be made from the very beginning.
A lot of components of products can be replaced, so the product does not have to be completely thrown away when it doesn’t work anymore. Your mobile devices like your laptop and phone could work like new when you use a combination of old and new parts!
Congratulations! You know what it means to remanufacture now.
That’s right. We can now move out of this industrial place to a more comfortable scenery.
